# *Registration system: legal person and physical person*

#### This repository aims to show the operation and code of the registration software for individuals and legal entities, being developed for my back-end repository, to show my skills with C# and .Net Framework.

## *Features:*

#### In this Software, we have the option to register individuals and calculate the tax that must be paid, the same thing also applies to legal entities.
#### The system has a CPF validator (individual registration in Brazil), birth date validator (in the case of an physical person), has a user input system and file registration (.txt and .csv). 
#### On the part of legal entities we have a validator of CNPJ (national registration of legal entities in Brazil).
#### It also has menus and submenus for registering and viewing registered objects for both cases. 
#### In the case of Individuals, the user must inform:
#### Name, Date of birth, CPF, Monthly income, address and answer if the address is business.
#### For Legal Entities, the user must inform:
#### Company Name, CNPJ, Corporate Name, Address and answer if the address is business.
